# File Handling Exercise
Part 1 – Text Files

For the first part of this exercise, assume you have a file called `students.txt` which contains a list of student names, with one name per line. Your goal is to write two functions:

1. `add_student`: This function accepts a parameter `first_name` and writes the `first_name` to the file `students.txt`.

2. `find_student`: This function accepts a parameter `first_name` and returns the first occurrence of the student with the given `first_name` from the file `students.txt`.

Bonuses:

3. `update_student`: This function accepts two parameters, `first_name` and `new_name`, and updates the first occurrence of the student with `first_name` to `new_name` in the file `students.txt`.

4. `remove_student`: This function accepts a parameter `first_name` and removes the first occurrence of the student with the given `first_name` from the file `students.txt`.

Additionally, it is suggested to add a unique ID for each student so that you can find a student by their ID instead of their first name, which would prevent issues when multiple students have the same first name.

Part 2 – CSV

For the next part of this exercise, you will be working with CSV files. Start by creating a file called `users.csv`. Then, implement the following two functions:

1. A function that reads the `users.csv` file and prints out all the first and last names of the users.

2. A function that prompts the user to enter a first and last name, and adds it to the `users.csv` file.

These functions will allow you to interact with the CSV file and perform operations such as reading and appending data.

That concludes the text explanation of the exercise. You can now proceed to implement the solution based on the provided instructions.
