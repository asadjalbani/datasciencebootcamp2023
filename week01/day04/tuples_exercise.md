# Tuple Exercises 

## Exercise 1: Creating and Accessing Tuples

1. Create a tuple named `fruits` with three of your favorite fruits.
2. Access and print the second element of the tuple.

## Exercise 2: Tuple Packing and Unpacking

1. Create a tuple named `student` with information about a student, such as name, age, and major.
2. Use tuple unpacking to assign each element of the tuple to separate variables.
3. Print the variables to display the student's information.

## Exercise 3: Concatenating Tuples

1. Create two tuples, `even_numbers` and `odd_numbers`, each containing integers.
2. Concatenate the two tuples to create a new tuple named `all_numbers`.
3. Print the `all_numbers` tuple to display the combined elements.

## Exercise 4: Nested Tuples

1. Create a tuple named `countries` with the names of three countries.
2. Create a nested tuple named `capital_cities` with the capital cities of the respective countries.
3. Access and print the capital city of the second country.

## Exercise 5: Tuple Slicing

1. Create a tuple named `numbers` with integers from 1 to 10.
2. Use slicing to create a new tuple named `even_numbers` containing only the even elements of the `numbers` tuple.
3. Print the `even_numbers` tuple.

## Exercise 6: Tuple Methods

1. Create a tuple named `colors` with different colors.
2. Use the `index()` method to find the index of a specific color in the `colors` tuple.
3. Use the `count()` method to count how many times a color appears in the `colors` tuple.

## Exercise 7: Converting Tuples to Lists and Vice Versa

1. Create a tuple named `months` with the names of the 12 months.
2. Convert the `months` tuple into a list named `months_list`.
3. Modify the `months_list` by adding an extra month at the end.
4. Convert the `months_list` back into a tuple named `updated_months`.
5. Print the `updated_months` tuple.

## Exercise 8: Tuple Comparison

1. Create two tuples, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, with some elements in common and some different elements.
2. Use comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) to compare the two tuples.
3. Print the result of each comparison.

## Exercise 9: Using `*` to Repeat Tuples

1. Create a tuple with a single element, and repeat the element 5 times using the `*` operator.
2. Print the resulting tuple.

## Exercise 10: `zip` Function with Tuples

1. Create two tuples, `names` and `ages`, with the names and ages of some people.
2. Use the `zip` function to combine the two tuples into a new tuple named `person_info`.
3. Print the `person_info` tuple.
