1. Given the dictionary `student_info = {'name': 'John', 'age': 21, 'major': 'Biology'}`, print the student's name and major.
2. Prompt the student to enter their new age and update the `age` value in the `student_info` dictionary.

## Exercise 3: Dictionary Methods

1. Create a dictionary called `grades` with the following key-value pairs: `'Math': 90, 'Science': 85, 'History': 78`.
2. Use the `keys()` method to print all the subjects in the `grades` dictionary.
3. Use the `values()` method to print all the grades in the `grades` dictionary.

## Exercise 4: Nested Dictionaries

1. Create a dictionary called `students` with two students. Each student should have the keys `'name'`, `'age'`, and `'courses'`.
2. For each student, the `'courses'` key should have a list of courses they are taking (e.g., `['Math', 'Science', 'History']`).
3. Print the list of courses for each student.
