# Pandas Lab Exercises

In this lab, you will work with Pandas, a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis. Use the following exercises to practice various aspects of Pandas, including data loading, data manipulation, filtering, aggregation, and more.

## Exercise 1: Data Loading

1. Load the provided CSV file "data.csv" into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Display the first 5 rows of the DataFrame.
3. Display the column names and data types in the DataFrame.

## Exercise 2: Data Manipulation

1. Create a new column in the DataFrame called "Total" that represents the sum of "Math" and "Science" scores for each student.
2. Update the "Status" column to "Pass" for students whose "Total" score is greater than or equal to 150, and "Fail" for students with a score less than 150.
3. Display the updated DataFrame.

## Exercise 3: Data Filtering

1. Filter the DataFrame to show only the rows where the "Gender" column is "Female" and the "Status" column is "Pass."
2. Display the filtered DataFrame.

## Exercise 4: Data Aggregation

1. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the "English" scores for male students.
2. Calculate the maximum "Total" score for female students.
3. Calculate the count of students in each "City" and display the result as a new DataFrame.

## Exercise 5: Data Visualization

1. Create a bar chart to visualize the average scores for each subject (Math, Science, English) across all students.
2. Create a pie chart to show the distribution of "Status" (Pass/Fail) among all students.

## Exercise 6: Data Input and Output

1. Save the modified DataFrame to a new CSV file named "modified_data.csv" without including the index.
2. Read the "modified_data.csv" file back into a new DataFrame and display its contents.

## Exercise 7: Data Merging

1. Create two DataFrames from the provided CSV files "students.csv" and "scores.csv."
2. Merge the two DataFrames based on the "Student ID" column to create a new DataFrame containing all the student information along with their respective scores.

## Conclusion

These exercises cover a wide range of Pandas functionalities, helping you practice data loading, manipulation, filtering, aggregation, visualization, and more. By completing these exercises, you will gain valuable hands-on experience with Pandas and be better prepared for real-world data analysis tasks. Happy coding! 🚀🐼👩‍💻👨‍💻
