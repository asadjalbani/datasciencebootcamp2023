## Day 01: [Machine Learning: Logistic Regression (Binary Classification)]

### Overview

Binary classification is a fundamental task in machine learning, where the goal is to predict one of two possible outcomes or classes based on input data. Logistic regression is one of the popular algorithms used for binary classification.

Logistic Regression was used in the biological sciences in early twentieth century. It was then used in many social science applications. Logistic Regression is used when the dependent variable(target) is categorical.

For example,

To predict whether an email is spam (1) or (0)
Whether the tumor is malignant (1) or not (0)
Consider a scenario where we need to classify whether an email is spam or not. If we use linear regression for this problem, there is a need for setting up a threshold based on which classification can be done. Say if the actual class is malignant, predicted continuous value 0.4 and the threshold value is 0.5, the data point will be classified as not malignant which can lead to serious consequence in real time.

From this example, it can be inferred that linear regression is not suitable for classification problem. Linear regression is unbounded, and this brings logistic regression into picture. Their value strictly ranges from 0 to 1.

* Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm 
* It is used to predict a binary outcome (1 / 0, Yes / No, True / False) given a set of independent variables.
* To represent binary / categorical outcome, we use dummy variables.
* * Logistic regression model is a linear model for binary classification that can be extended to multiclass classification.

> Model
- Output: 0 or 1
- Hypthesis => Z = mx + b
- h(x) = sigmoid(Z)

### Sigmoid function
* The sigmoid function, also called the logistic function gives an 'S' shaped curve that can take any real-valued number and map it into a value between 0 and 1.
* The function maps the input space to a probability space.

If ‘Z’ goes to infinity, Y(predicted) will become 1 and if ‘Z’ goes to negative infinity, Y(predicted) will become 0.
