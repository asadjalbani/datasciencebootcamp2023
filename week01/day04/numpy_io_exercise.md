# NumPy I/O Exercise

**Exercise 1:**

You are given a NumPy array containing student scores in an exam. Save this array to a file named `scores.txt` in CSV format (comma-separated values). Then, load the data back into a new NumPy array and calculate the average score.

**Exercise 2:**

You have two NumPy arrays, `grades` and `students`, containing the grades of different students. Each row in the `grades` array represents a student's scores in different subjects. The `students` array contains the names of the students corresponding to each row in the `grades` array. Save these arrays to a file named `student_grades.npy` in NumPy binary format. Then, load the data back into new arrays and find the student with the highest average score.

**Exercise 3:**

You are provided with a text file named `data.txt`, which contains a matrix of numbers in tab-separated format. Load this data into a NumPy array and calculate the sum of each row. Save the resulting array to a file named `row_sums.npy` in NumPy binary format.

**Exercise 4:**

You are given two NumPy arrays, `arr1` and `arr2`, representing the x and y coordinates of points in a 2D plane. Save these arrays to a file named `points.txt` in CSV format. Then, load the data back into new arrays and plot the points on a scatter plot using Matplotlib.

**Exercise 5:**

Create a NumPy array containing the numbers 1 to 1000. Save this array to a file named `numbers.npy` in NumPy binary format. Then, load the data back into a new array and calculate the sum of all prime numbers in the array.

These exercises will help you practice various aspects of NumPy I/O, including saving and loading data from different file formats. Happy coding with NumPy! ðŸš€ðŸ”¢
